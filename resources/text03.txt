My University
 I think everybody knows that education is necessary to be successful in our life. I would like to work in the field of physical culture and sports in future and to become a professional sportsman and a basketball coach. To get my profession I need a university graduation. So after finishing school I passed the entrance exams and entered Chuvash State Pedagogical University, the faculty of physical education. It will be a long course – five years of hard and constant studies: lectures, seminars, practical classes and test periods. The academic year lasts for 10 months and there are vacations twice a year: in winter and summer.  I feel proud of my faculty as among its graduates are the winners of many Olympic games and  the world champions.

 The University is very old, it was founded in 1930 in the centre of the capital of Chuvash Republic – Cheboksary city. It was named for the talented Chuvash teacher Ivan Yakovlev. The establishment has developed rapidly since then, now it has become one of the largest universities of Russia. Today it gives students an opportunity to choose higher and post-graduate educational programs for 42 professions. The education is provided by qualified specialists, professors and doctors. There are 12 full-time faculties at the University which enroll more than 6000 students.   There are the faculties of Music and Art, Foreign languages, Psychology, Science, History and Philology, Pre-school education and many others. The University includes 6 academic buildings with spacious classrooms, a modern library, a reading-room, well-equipped laboratories and workshops, computer rooms, gymnasiums and dining-rooms.

 I’m sure that studying at Chuvash State Pedagogical University will give me much knowledge, in theory and practice, and prepare me for effective and interesting work.
