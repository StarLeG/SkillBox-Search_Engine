MY FAVOURITE BOOK
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE AN EDUCATED PERSON WITHOUT GOOD BOOKS. MOST OF THE BOOKS ARE TO BE READ JUST ONCE, OTHERS CAN BE READ PLENTY OF TIMES. AND EACH TIME YOU FIND SOMETHING NEW AND USEFUL AS YOU TURN THE SAME PAGES OF YOUR FAVOURITE BOOKS. I AM FOND OF BOOKS ABOUT ADVENTURES AND GREAT PEOPLE, DETECTIVE STORIES AND SCIENCE FICTION. I ENJOY READING THEM WHEN I HAVE SPARE TIME.BUT MY FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIMES IS A NOVEL "THREE COMRADES" WRITTEN BY A GERMAN WRITER ERICH MARIA REMARQUE. THIS BOOK WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME BY MY ELDER SISTER AND I'M GRATEFUL TO HER FOR THAT ADVICE. IT WAS REALLY WORTH READING.
"THREE COMRADES" IS A BOOK ABOUT LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP OF THREE COMMON PEOPLE (ROBERT, OTTO AND GOTTFRIED) WHO LIVED IN GERMANY BETWEEN THE TWO WORLD WARS. THE MAIN CHARACTERS ARE REAL FRIENDS WHO STRUGGLE TOGETHER WITH POVERTY AND VIOLENCE AND THEY MANAGE TO PRESERVE THEIR DIGNITY AND HUMANITY. THE STORY OF BEAUTIFUL AND TRAGIC LOVE BETWEEN ROBERT AND PAT IS HEART-BREAKING BECAUSE THE GIRL DIES OF TUBERCULOSIS.
I FIND THE BOOK VERY POWERFUL AND DEEPLY MOVING. IT TEACHES PEOPLE TO FIND THE INNER STRENGTH TO LIVE IN A TOUGH WORLD. IT OFTEN HELPS ME WHEN I FIND MYSELF IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION AND I NEED AN ANSWER TO SOME QUESTION. IT IS MY GREAT FRIEND AND TEACHER.
